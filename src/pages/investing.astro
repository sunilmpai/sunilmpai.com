<Layout title="Investing — Sunil M Pai">
  <h1>Investing</h1>
  <p>I began my individual investing career in 2019 as a scout for Lightspeed Venture Partners. They trusted my instincts and gave me a pool of capital to invest at my sole discretion.</p>
  <p>My first fund is sitting at 8x DPI (distributed 8+ times the capital originally invested) and on track to reach 13.5x when fully realized.</p>
  <p>Since deploying the fund, I have been investing personal capital as an angel.</p>

  <h1>Advising</h1>
  <p>I serve as a hands-on advisor to several startups:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Akash Systems</strong> – Custom-built servers with diamond-based thermal management for AI workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Daylight Computer</strong> – A new kind of computer.</li>
    <li><strong>[Stealth]</strong> – A fintech incubation with Guy Oseary.</li>
    <li><strong>[Stealth]</strong> – A productivity-focused software and services company.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>What I Look For</h1>
  <p>I love investing because I love being in dialogue with people who are at the pinnacle of their fields. I am Founder-driven investor and have invested in everything from early stage B2B SaaS to an oil refinery project in The Gambia.

    I like to help founders with growth/distribution, product, operational discipline, and fundraising.
    
    I work best with founders that communicate transparently, are often technical or very structured in their thinking, and operate with a high degree of agency.</p>
